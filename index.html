        <h2>How to Play Scoundrel</h2>
        <hr />
        <p class="modal-txt">Set-up and goal:</p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          Scoundrel is played with a standard 52 card deck with the all red
          Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks removed (end result of a 44 card deck).
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          Your health starts at 20. It can never go higher than 20. If it ever
          gets to 0, you lose.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          The top four cards are placed in front of you. These are collectively
          known as a "room", which you will have to clear (described more in the
          rules section).
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          To win, get through the entire deck and clear out the final room
          entirely.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p class="modal-txt">Rules</p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          The 26 black cards (clubs and spades) are monsters. They deal damage
          equal to their value (2-10, Jack is 11, Queen is 12, King is 13, and
          Ace is 14).
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          The 9 diamonds are weapons. These block an amount of monster damage
          equal to their value once equiped. Equiped diamonds are placed below
          the four room cards. Once picked up, diamonds MUST be equiped, even if
          you have to discard your currently equiped daimond to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          The 9 hearts are health potions, restoring health equal to their
          value. You can only use one health potion per turn, if there are more
          in the room, they must be discarded instead. You can never go above 20
          health.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p class="modal-txt">Gameplay</p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          At the start of each turn, flip cards off the top of the deck until
          there are four infront of you. This is a "room" in the dungeon.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          You can flee from a room if you haven't interacted with it yet. If you
          do, those four cards are placed on the bottom of the deck, aka, the
          dungeon. You can flee as much as you want, but never twice in a row.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          If you decide to face a room, you need to clear 3 of the 4 cards it
          contains in order to move onto the next turn/room.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          If you chose a diamond, you MUST equip it (even if doing so discards
          your currently equiped weapon).
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          If you chose a heart, dragging it to your health, you heal for that
          much. You can only heal ONCE per turn. Other hearts need to be
          discarded if not kept as the last card of the four card room.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          If you chose a clubs or spades, you fight the monster. If you drag it
          to your health (or have no weapon equiped) you will fight it unarmed,
          taking the full damage. It is then discarded. If you fight a monster
          with your weapon by dragging it onto your weapon, it will deal damage
          equal to it's power - your weapon's power. NOTE: in this case, keep
          the monster on top of the weapon. Once used on a monster, a weapon can
          only be used against a monster with LESS power than the one most
          recently defeated.
        </p>

          THERE IS NO UNDO BUTTON - take care before you make any moves.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          Hovering over the deck will show you how many cards are left in it.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-txt indent">
          When dragging a card, suitable places to drop it will highlight as you
          pass over them. Green will heal you, gold will equip the card, dark
          red will fight a monster, and bright red will discard.
